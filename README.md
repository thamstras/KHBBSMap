## Building
This project uses [Premake 5](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/releases) to generate it's build files. You'll also need the following:

* [GLFW 3.3](https://www.glfw.org/)
* [GLM 0.9.9](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)
* [Assimp 5.0.1](https://www.assimp.org/)

This poject also uses [Dear Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) and [stb_image/stb_image_write](https://github.com/nothings/stb) but these libraries are included in the source.
 
 Once you've modified the relevant paths at the top of `premake.lua` then build files can be generated by running
 `premake5 vs2019` where `vs2019` can be substituted for your prefered IDE/Toolchain. For more info and a list of toolchains see `premake5 --help`.
 
  If using a compiler other than MSVC you might need to tweak some stuff in `FileManager.cpp` to get it to compile without issues.
